# WDBX Next Steps Recommendation

This document outlines the recommended next steps for the WDBX project to bring it to production readiness.

## 1. Resolve Remaining Linter Errors

### Type Annotation Issues in core.py
- Fix NumPy array type annotations by properly importing `NDArray` and providing type arguments
- Ensure consistent return types for all methods, especially in search functions
- Add proper type annotations for callback functions and event handlers

### Unused Imports & Variable Cleanup
- Complete removal of unused imports across all modules
- Eliminate unused variables and dead code
- Standardize import ordering (standard library, third-party, local)

### Function Parameter Typing
- Ensure all function parameters have appropriate type annotations
- Use consistent typing for similar parameters across different modules
- Add docstring type information that matches the annotations

### Implementation
- Create a dedicated linting workflow with pre-commit hooks
- Generate typing stub files (.pyi) for complex modules
- Add typing tests to verify type compatibility

## 2. Expand Testing

### Plugin-Specific Tests
- **Visualization Plugin**: Test all visualization types with sample data
- **Model Repository Plugin**: Test model registration, switching, and command dispatching
- **Integration Plugins**:
  - **Ollama**: Test model listing, embedding generation, and text generation
  - **OpenAI**: Test API connection, embedding creation, and response handling
  - **HuggingFace**: Test model discovery and embedding functions
  - **Discord**: Test bot connection and message handling

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between the model repository and individual model providers
- Verify that embeddings created by different plugins are compatible
- Test visualization of embeddings from different sources
- Verify end-to-end workflows involving multiple plugins

### Performance Tests
- Create benchmarks for embedding generation and storage
- Test vector similarity search performance with large datasets
- Measure concurrent request handling capabilities
- Analyze memory usage patterns under different workloads

### Implementation
- Use pytest for unit and integration testing
- Implement test fixtures for common test data and configurations
- Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Add code coverage reporting and enforcement

## 3. Deploy and Containerize

> **Note**: A comprehensive deployment guide has been created in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md). This section outlines additional work needed beyond the current deployment capabilities.

### Docker Containers

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Create Kubernetes manifests for deploying WDBX
- Set up StatefulSets for data persistence
- Configure horizontal pod autoscaling based on load
- Implement resource limits and requests for optimal performance
- Design network policies for secure inter-service communication

### Infrastructure as Code
- Develop Terraform configurations for cloud deployments
- Create Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments
- Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Implement backup and disaster recovery processes

### Continuous Deployment
- Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
