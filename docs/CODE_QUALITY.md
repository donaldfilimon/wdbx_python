# Code Quality Guide

<!-- category: Development -->
<!-- priority: 50 -->
<!-- tags: code quality, standards, linting, testing -->

This guide outlines the code quality standards and practices used in the WDBX project.

## Overview

We maintain high code quality through:

1. Automated linting and formatting
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Code review processes
4. Documentation standards

## Code Style

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions
- Maximum line length of 100 characters
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Documentation Style

- Use clear and concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up to date with code
- Follow Markdown style guidelines

## Linting Tools

We use several linting tools to maintain code quality:

1. **ruff** - Fast Python linter
2. **black** - Code formatter
3. **isort** - Import sorter
4. **mypy** - Type checker

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use pytest for testing
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions
- Verify API contracts
- Test database operations
- Check plugin functionality

## Code Review Process

1. Create descriptive pull requests
2. Address all linter issues
3. Ensure test coverage
4. Get approval from maintainers

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines

- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle errors appropriately

### Performance

- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Optimize critical paths
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider memory usage

### Security

- Follow security best practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use secure dependencies
- Handle sensitive data properly

## Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline checks:

1. Code style compliance
2. Test coverage
3. Documentation quality
4. Security vulnerabilities

## Tools and Configuration

### Linter Configuration

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py39"
select = ["E", "F", "B", "I"]

[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py39']

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 100
```

### Test Configuration

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
addopts = "--cov=wdbx --cov-report=term-missing"
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

We track code quality metrics:

- Test coverage percentage
- Linter violations
- Documentation coverage
- Technical debt

## Contributing

When contributing:

1. Run all linters locally
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation
4. Follow code review process
