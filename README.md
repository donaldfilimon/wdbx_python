# WDBX: Wide Distributed Block Exchange

**`WORK IN PROGRESS`**

WDBX is a high-throughput, low-latency data store designed for multi-persona AI systems. It combines advanced techniques from vector similarity search, blockchain-based integrity, multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), and multi-head attention to support robust and scalable AI applications.

## Features

- **Embedding Vector Storage:** Efficiently store, update, and search high-dimensional embedding vectors using FAISS.
- **Blockchain-Inspired Data Integrity:** Create and validate blocks that chain together embedding vectors.
- **MVCC Concurrency:** Handle simultaneous read/write operations safely.
- **Neural Backtracking:** Trace activation patterns and detect semantic drift.
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Implement transformer-like attention for sequence modeling.
- **Multi-Persona Framework:** Manage multiple AI personas and blend responses.
- **Content Filtering & Bias Mitigation:** Ensure safe and balanced responses.
- **Asynchronous HTTP Server:** Expose API endpoints using aiohttp.

### Installation

- Install dependencies with:

#### Install Dependencies for later... (optional mostly for now)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Database Client/Server
```bash
python database.py
```

---

#### Development Status

```The WDBX project is currently in active development, with a fully functional Python implementation available for immediate use alongside ongoing work on the high-performance version.```

#### Current Implementation

The current Python implementation (`database.py`) is ready for production use and:
- Requires only standard library dependencies
- Supports Python versions 3.9 through 3.13
- Provides all core functionality described in the Features section
- Offers excellent performance for most use cases

#### Roadmap

The high-performance version is under active development and will include:
- JAX acceleration for vector operations
- Enhanced security implementations
- Distributed processing capabilities
- Optimized indexing and search algorithms
- Comprehensive benchmark suite

Development progress can be tracked in the project repository. The estimated release timeframe for the high-performance version is Q3 2023.

##### Backstory

WDBX was originally conceived and implemented in C and C++ to achieve maximum performance and resource efficiency. The project was designed from first principles to create a robust and scalable data store specifically optimized for multi-persona AI systems. 

The core architecture leverages advanced techniques across multiple domains:
- Vector similarity search algorithms for efficient embedding retrieval
- Blockchain-inspired integrity verification protocols
- Multiversion concurrency control for consistent transaction handling
- Multi-head attention mechanisms inspired by transformer architectures

While the C/C++ implementation remains the foundation for performance-critical components, Python was integrated to accelerate development cycles and improve accessibility. Python's rich ecosystem of machine learning and AI libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.) enables rapid prototyping and integration with existing AI workflows. The Python implementation also significantly lowers the barrier to entry for contributors and adopters.

The dual-language approach allows WDBX to maintain both the performance benefits of lower-level implementations and the development speed and flexibility offered by Python, making it an ideal choice for research, production, and experimental AI applications.
