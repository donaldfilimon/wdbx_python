# WDBX: Wide Distributed Block Database

**`WORK IN PROGRESS`**

WDBX is a super-speedy, ultra-responsive data store made for multi-personality AI systems. It mixes up cool tricks from vector similarity search, blockchain-style integrity, multiversion concurrency control (MV), and multi-head attention to keep your AI apps running smooth and strong.

## Features

- **Embedding Vector Storage:** Stash, tweak, and hunt down high-dimensional embedding vectors usingISS.
- **Blockchain-Inspired Data Integrity:** Build and check blocks that link embedding vectors together.
- **MVCC Concurrency:** Juggle read/write operations like a pro.
- **Neural Backtracking:** Follow activation patterns and spot semantic drift.
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Apply transformer-like attention for sequence modeling.
- **Multi-Persona Framework:** Handle multiple AI personas and mix responses.
- **Content Filtering & Bias Mitigation:** Keep responses safe and balanced.
- **Asynchronous HTTP Server:** Serve up API endpoints using aiohttp### Installation

- Get your dependencies with#### Install Dependencies for later... (optional mostly for now)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Database Client/Server
```bash

#### Development Status

```The WDBX project currently in active development, with a fully functional Python implementation available for immediate use alongside ongoing work on the high-performance version.```

#### Roadmap Implementation

The current Python implementationdatabase.py`) is ready for production use and:
- Needs only standard library dependencies
- Works with Python versions 3.9 through 3.13
- Delivers all the core features mentioned above
- Boasts excellent performance for most scenarios
- JAX acceleration for jit acceleration in MLIR
